Bella is a cute dog who loves her family almost as much as she loves treats. When Abby, her owner, was back from college, she decided to take Bella on a run. As they were running, Bella saw a huge treat shaped like a squirrel. She ripped the leash in half and ran towards it, forgetting about Abby.

Bella chased the squirrel as fast as she could. As she approached the squirrel, Abby yelled for her to come back. But Bella was on a mission. She leaped for the furry little treat and chomped.
