Bella is a cute dog who loves her family almost as much as she loves treats. When Abby, her owner, was back from college, she decided to take Bella on a run. As they were running, Bella saw a huge treat shaped like a squirrel. She ripped the leash in half and ran towards it, forgetting about Abby.

Bella chased the squirrel as fast as she could. As she approached the squirrel, Abby yelled for her to come back. But Bella was on a mission. She leaped for the furry little treat and chomped.

Got 'em! Bella jumped around happily as she held the squirrel's fur in her mouth, not letting go. Unfortunately, Bella's happiness was short lived as Abby had quickly caught up to her and ripped the squirrel out of Bella's mouth.

Abby was distraught that that Bella could have done something to a poor little squirrel. She became so moved by seeing the small squirrel that she decided to hold a small funeral for the squirrel calling all of its relatives before laying to rest in her backyard.
